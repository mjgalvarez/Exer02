Steps on how to create GitHub page:
1. go to the repository where you want to create the page
2. go to settings
3. click Pages
4. browse and look for the branch section
5. change none into main, then save it
6. wait for a moment then refresh
7. there should be new section at the top "your site is live at <link>"

Key takeaways:
- I had a hard time deciding on the class and id. At least now I have a bit of experience I would improve more. 
- I have learn how to use flexbox but still I hope instead of providing boxes, I would be able to use image instead.
